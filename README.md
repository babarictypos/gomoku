# Gomoku
Gomoku engine with tkinter GUI - beats me (beginner) more than 50% of the time

# Usage
Run Game.py, click on a tile to play as a white (implemented unconventionally as player one). Click any empty tile on the board and the engine will play a move. Upon victory, the game will flash either black or white for the victor, then the window will automatically close.

# History
My first ever coding project outside of hello world/ Visual basic calculator GUIs and macroing.

# Version
This version is used as an archive, however a second version with more efficient logic and evaluation is being implemented. Alpha-beta pruning will (hopefully) be used to optimise depth searching.
